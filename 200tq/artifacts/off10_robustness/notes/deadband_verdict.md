## Analysis

### Why Deadband Has No Effect

The OFF10 Ensemble strategy (E03) trades with the following pattern:

1. **ON State**: TQQQ 100%
2. **OFF State**: TQQQ 10% + SGOV 90%

The only weight changes are:

- **ON → OFF**: 100% → 10% = **90%p change** (far exceeds any deadband)
- **OFF → ON**: 10% → 100% = **90%p change** (far exceeds any deadband)

Since the strategy has **no intermediate rebalancing** within ON or OFF states,
and signal transitions are **exempt** from deadband filtering,
the deadband layer has **zero practical effect**.

### Trade Frequency Analysis

- **E03**: 52 trades over ~16 years = **3.3 trades/year**
- **E30**: 52 trades (identical)
- **E31**: 52 trades (identical)

> **Conclusion**: The strategy is already extremely low-turnover.
> Deadband is unnecessary for E03.

## Recommendation

### ⏭️ SKIP DEADBAND LAYER

The deadband layer is not applicable to E03 because:

1. **No small rebalances exist** - only binary ON/OFF transitions
2. **Current turnover is minimal** - only 3.3 trades/year
3. **No cost savings possible** - would require regime-change trades anyway

### Alternative Consideration

If future enhancements add intermediate states (e.g., partial positions),
reconsider deadband at that time.
