# Sensitivity Analysis Highlights

**Status**: Limited sensitivity data available

## Summary

Unable to perform detailed sensitivity analysis. The sensitivity table 
may not contain the expected cost grid data.

## Recommendations

1. Re-run experiments with explicit cost sensitivity grid
2. Include slippage scenarios (0, 5, 10, 20, 30 bps)
