# Decision: V2.3 SEC Canonical Layer Stable Lock

## Context

After V2.3 implementation and coverage analysis, we determined the coverage ceiling
under low-false-positive constraints.

## Coverage Status (Final)

| Metric            | Value                           |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Overall Coverage  | ~74% (27 canonical items)       |
| total_liabilities | 87.6% (with computed fallbacks) |
| any_sec_present   | 44.3% (in alpha dataset)        |

## Secondary Fallback Analysis

**C \ (A ∪ B) = 0** — Assets-SE fallback provides **zero additional coverage**.
All cases covered by LSE-SE are also covered by Assets-SE (complete overlap).

## Decision

1. **Lock V2.3 as stable** — No further coverage expansion attempts
2. **Keep Assets-SE fallback** — Zero cost, edge case safety net
3. **Focus shifts to utilization** — How to best use 44% SEC coverage in ML

## Rationale

- Stockholders_equity expansion: 0 potential (98.9% coverage, 2 special structure companies)
- Revenues expansion: Low potential (alt tags are "Income" ≠ "Revenue")
- CFO expansion: 0 potential (98.5% coverage)

## Next Steps

- [ ] Feature engineering: NaN → 0 + `is_missing` indicator
- [ ] Same top_k comparison for fair Tech vs Fund evaluation
- [ ] Investigate IC ↑ but backtest ↓ disconnect
